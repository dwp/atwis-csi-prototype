    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27 govuk-!-margin-top-2">After you apply for the grant</h2>

    <p>Someone from Access to Work will contact you to talk about your application.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      If phone calls are difficult for you (for example, because you’re deaf or hard of hearing), you can ask for all communication to be by email instead.
    </div>

    <p>The person who contacts you may ask:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>for more information about your work and condition</li>
    <li>for permission to speak to your employer</li>
    <li>to arrange for an assessor to call you or view your workplace by video call or in person - to find out what changes might help</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You’ll get a letter with a decision and explanation. It will tell you how much your grant will be and what it should pay for.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If your circumstances change</h3>

    <p>You must tell Access to Work by calling the helpline if your circumstances change.</p>
    <p>This could be if, for example:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your name, address, contact details or workplace address changes</li>
    <li>you change jobs</li>
    <li>your disability, illness or health condition changes</li>
    </ul>
