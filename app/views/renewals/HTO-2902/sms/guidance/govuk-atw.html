    <p>Access to Work can help you get or stay in work if you have a physical or mental health condition or disability.</p>
    <p>The support you get will depend on your needs. Through Access to Work, you can apply for:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a grant to help pay for practical support with your work</li>
      <li>advice about managing your mental health at work</li>
      <li>money to pay for communication support at job interviews</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      This guide is also available in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/mynediad-at-waith">Welsh (Cymraeg)</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0aQWFFHARzJYt8cED-WX1g5jD0mApTv">British Sign Language (BSL)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easy-read-get-help-at-work-if-youre-disabled-or-have-a-health-condition-access-to-work">Easy Read format</a>.
    </div>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Practical support with your work</h3>

    <p>Access to Work could give you a grant to help pay for things like:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>BSL interpreters, lip speakers or note takers</li>
      <li>adaptations to your vehicle so you can get to work</li>
      <li>taxi fares to work or a support worker if you cannot use public transport</li>
      <li>a support worker or job coach to help you in your workplace</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your workplace can include your home if you work from there some or all of the time.</p>
    <p>It does not matter how much you earn. If you get an Access to Work grant, it will not affect any other benefits you get and you will not have to pay it back.</p>
    <p>You or your employer may need to pay some costs up front and claim them back later.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Communication support for job interviews</h3>
