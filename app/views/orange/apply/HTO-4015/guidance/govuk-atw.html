    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-27 govuk-!-margin-top-2">What Access to Work is</h2>

    <p>Access to Work can help you get or stay in work if you have a physical or mental health condition or disability.</p>
    <p>The support you get will depend on your needs. Through Access to Work, you can apply for:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a grant to help pay for practical support with your work</li>
      <li>advice about managing your mental health at work</li>
      <li>money to pay for communication support at job interviews</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      This guide is also available in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/mynediad-at-waith">Welsh (Cymraeg)</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0aQWFFHARzJYt8cED-WX1g5jD0mApTv">British Sign Language (BSL)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easy-read-get-help-at-work-if-youre-disabled-or-have-a-health-condition-access-to-work">Easy Read format</a>.
    </div>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Practical support with your work</h3>

    <p>Access to Work could give you a grant to help pay for things like:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li><mark>specialist equipment and assistive software</li>
      <li><mark>support workers, like a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter or a job coach</li>
      <li><mark>taxi fares to work, if you cannot use public transport</li>
      <li><mark>physical changes to your workplace</li>
      <li><mark>adaptations to your vehicle so you can get to work</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your workplace can include your home if you work from there some or all of the time.</p>
    <p>It does not matter how much you earn. If you get an Access to Work grant, it will not affect any other benefits you get and you will not have to pay it back.</p>
    <p>You or your employer may need to pay some costs up front and claim them back later.</p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to apply</h4>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Mental health support</h3>

    <p>You can get support to manage your mental health at work.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      You do not need to be diagnosed with a condition to apply for mental health support.
    </div>

    <p>You can apply for mental health support directly from <a rel="external" href="https://able-futures.co.uk/individuals">Able Futures</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.remploy.co.uk/employers/mental-health-and-wellbeing/workplace-mental-health-support-service-employers">Remploy</a>. This is funded by Access to Work.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="govuk-apply">apply for an Access to Work grant</a> if you think there’s practical support that could help you do your job.</p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Communication support for job interviews</h3>

    <p>Access to Work can help pay for communication support at a job interview if:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you’re deaf or hard of hearing and need a BSL interpreter or lipspeaker</li>
      <li>you have a physical or mental health condition or learning difficulty and need communication support</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What Access to Work will not pay for</h3>

    <p>Access to Work will not pay for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers">reasonable adjustments</a>. These are the changes your employer must legally make to support you to do your job.</p>

    <p>Access to Work will advise your employer if changes should be made as reasonable adjustments.</p>
